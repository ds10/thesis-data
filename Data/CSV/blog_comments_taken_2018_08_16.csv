Is there something to be said for an organisational culture where people can openly admit they don't want to be involved with a project? I suppose you could end up with projects that nobody wants to be on and does that mean that there is something wrong with the project or that you have the wrong staff? :-),1,0,,0,102

To answer your question ""does this style of presenting information really have to be seen as for beginners or children?"" I really hope not.  Maybe, from an objective standpoint, it could be best seen as an accessible approach to writing rather than a somehow dumbed-down style.

Digesting the content of books and journals has been one of the biggest challenges of my PhD adventure so far.  I sometimes spend that much time trying to understand the language being used, including trips to the dictionary with some publications, that I find it difficult or impossible to appreciate the meaning, the context, the subtleties of the piece.  I'm not from a particularly literary educational background but I'm a reasonably intelligent graduate.  It shouldn't take me one hour, a dictionary and two or three attempts to understand four or five pages of a book.

I know we've already talked about the ""Mindw&amp;nk"" theory that a friend told me about, which boiled down to some authors' obsession with cramming as many difficult words and terms as possible into their work.  To me this can be intentional or unintentional.

The Unintentional Mindw&amp;nk.  Those authors who unwittingly produce impenetrable work.  It must be easy for someone with a brilliant mind, who moves in intellectual circles, talking about a potentially difficult and/or niche subject area, to fall into this trap.  There's a lot of skill involved in explaining something complicated to a layperson in an understandable way without compromising the integrity of the topic.

The Intentional Mindw&amp;nk.  Does every author want their material to be accessible to those outside of their intellectual club?  Does making it difficult to understand protect the exclusivity of their work?  Sort of an in joke or a knowing nod of the head between academics?  I think these might be the Mindw&amp;nkers my friend was referring to.

Are certain situations more likely to produce the Unintentional Mindw&amp;nk?  Who knows, after three years of working with LD I might start talking in XML.  Are journals more or less likely to produce the Intentional Mindw&amp;nk than a book?  Is there more incentive for an author to try and make things accessible when they want to earn some money from it on Amazon?  If someone is pitching a paper to their peers who read a niche journal will they want to sound as intellectual as possible, whatever the knock-on effect for anyone less knowledgeable who might be trying to get an academic foothold in the subject area?  Would this situation be both an Intentional Mindw&amp;nk (Mindw&amp;nking on their peers if you will) and an Unintentional Mindw&amp;nk (because they hadn't considered the potentially wider audience)?",1,0,,0,105

I am 62 years old and for my wife and I everything sounds like crap because unless the message is ""authentic"", it is surely manufactured. Oh, sure you can call us cynical old farts because we are. What you are hearing is reality, behind the curtin is a toilet. As you get older and older the more you will hear and see a lot the crap that you believed in become the myth used to control you. This is why I am a part of a growing community of storytellers, who believe in the power of authentic personal stories. Ordinary people now have the ways and means to tell and share their stories with thousands of people. I propose that students be encouraged to write and produce their own authentic stories as project based, blended learning assignments. By giving them the opportunity to learn core concepts while producing something of socially redeeming value is supplying them with the critical thinking skills to tell the difference between the crap and those things that really matter.

Assuming that a website is ""standards compliant"" should it be the role of software/hardware designers to ensure that content is usable on their devices?

For example the web browser supplied with my mobile phone was horrendous but now I use Opera Mobile and on the whole it does a really good job of resizing the main text of a webpage to fit the screen width.  It struggles with some websites but I suspect these haven't been designed from a ""device agnostic"" point of view.

Are proprietary technologies such as Flash also part of the problem?  When an entire website is presented in Flash it means I can't access it on my mobile phone.  But thinking about other audiences how does this affect a visually impaired user's ability to ""view"" the website content using something like a screen reader?",1,0,,0,209

The point is to get designers to think the other way around because the capabilities of the desktop browsers and mobile browsers are different - as is the issue of filesizes, etc.

""Mobile First"" simply means Progressive Enhancement and I think designers know this (I fear you're coming from too deep in the developer/code monkey arena, mate). Mobile First means focusing on the essentials for a mobile context then scaling up for larger devices. If you read up on the articles by the people banging this drum you'll see that they actually are talking 'device agnostic' as they are championing a technique that designs and build for one web...rather than ""mobile web"" and ""desktop web"", which we all know doesn't exist.

I don't think any web designer worth their gravy would ever start to view the issue as 'mobile matters more than desktop'. Mobile First is an approach that enables designs to be fluid across devices. It's just that it centres the First Stop on mobile as there the restrictions lie - ie. build for those restrictions...screen size, image size, scripting, etc - then adapt for larger screens wrt to sizes and layouts, etc.",1,0,,0,211

You've validated my point by saying that designers know that mobile first simply means progressive enhancement but then assuming bottleneck restrictions lie with mobile devices.

My point is the restrictions DO NOT lie with mobile, there is a increase in the many different ways people access the web. My wii remote is a restriction as are my twin desktop screens, mobile screen size, ps3 analogue sticks, the cheap screens HTC bung in the wildfire, my tv remote, etc etc.  Simply I think we should not be assuming that restrictions are just mobile and that is why I don't like the term.

Maybe I didn't explain very well, this is with my developer hat off and web user hat on. My post says that the things you are talking about are great! But as a web user I get far more annoyed when  browsing with my Wii remote more than I ever do with my mobile device. Yes I want progressive enhancement.

When I say ""restrictions"" I'm simply talking about the support for CSS media queries, which is what underpins the adaptability for display on different screen sizes. My understanding is that support for this differs on desktop browsers but is pretty much standard across mobile...hence the ""mobile first"" approach.

And it's not really about bottleneck restrictions, it's more about the user paying for the data consumed on mobile - that's why addressing size matters. If you think about the amount of stuff web designers throw into websites you can understand that this is something of key importance when it comes to delivering the same site to a mobile context.",1,0,,0,213

It's not just about scaling to fit, there is so much more than that! What about the input device?

You can't start with mobile and 'scale up' to wii because they are completely different, as are many other devices.

Finally this quote sticks in my mind:

""Graphs can be a powerful way to represent relationships between data, but they are also a very abstract concept, which means that they run the danger of meaning something only to the creator of the graph. Often, simply showing the structure of the data says very little about what it actually means, even though it’s a perfectly accurate means of representing the data. Everything looks like a graph, but almost nothing should ever be drawn as one."" Ben Fry in ‘Visualizing Data’

Meaning something only to the creator if perfectly valid if it helps them understand the bigger picture, but you've still got to find a way to communicate the result.

I spoke with four of the five Paterno children and also with his wife Sue, and they are furious with the university leaders for the way they fired Paterno, and also for the fact that there was very little outreach once Paterno announced he had cancer. President Rodney Erickson didn't call him or send so much as a get well card, according to the family. They finally heard from him when he sent a thank yuo note for a $100,000 gift Paterno gave the university last week. That sort of thing seriously upset his family. Paterno was actually the peacekeeper while I was in the house. He kept saying he didn't want to be bitter, and his relations with the school were very important to him. <a href=""http://www.deutschlandtrikot2013.net/"" 0=""/"" rel=""nofollow"">dfb trikot</a> Then i turned around and some fat Mac guy with a beard in a gray shirt gave me a wierd look, i would describe it as the ""You made fun of Apple, now im gonna have to go cry in the corner"" look.

Possibly true, but I can't help wondering how some of the above critiques of badges might be applied to HE institutions...
- Teaching to the test
- Easy degree courses
- Institutional facilities and 'experience'
- New institutions/ increase in studying abroad?
There's lots of practice within the HE sector which is potentially as questionable as badges if we subject them to the same level and type of analysis [not disagreeing with you but I was struck by how I could think of examples in HE].",1,0,,0,244

I am particularly interested in inflation and HE. I'll save that for another post but I guess badges as a sort of global currency has re-sparked my interest in it.

The badges in games such as City of Heroes were, as I recall, often milestones (or progress markers), which can be useful in a non-linear environment where exploration has a complex topography. Other badges summarized a recent behaviour pattern (perhaps acknowledging an online behaviour characterized as helpful - or otherwise - such as answering calls for help).

Sure, the design of badges and the meaning of the metrics are at the heart of the matter, and they are not a replacement for subjective (human) feedback, but complementary to it.

Generally, I expect you have to weight levels exponentially (such as bronze for 10 logins, silver for 100, gold for 1000 and so on) which creates a more meaningful break in levels.

Where you are trying to reward people for creating content, and perhaps unlock higher level roles with increased permissions, then perhaps badges and their underlying records can play an important role. For example, you may restrict eligibility to moderate a list to people who have contributed 10 items to it (or whatever).

A reputation badge can be seen as a useful indicator for characterizing an unknown person (for example, in XBox Live, apparently people who disconnect from FIFA football matches have their percentage reputation lowered to reflect probable bad sportsmanship and warn future opponents).",1,0,,0,246

This is great - and you raise some very interesting issues, about our use and collection of data. I've found that there lots of standards and actually more different types of technologies in use across programmes. However there are very low instances of lots of them which makes visualisation and making sense of things quite challenging. So, as we discussed yesterday maybe what we need to do to a further refinement of the most popular ones, and then have maybe just a simple list of the other instances as an appendix. Lots to think about!

USPrÃ¤sident George Bush stellte 1989 eine aus amerikanischer Sicht nicht zu verhandelnde Bedingung fÃ¼r eine Wiedervereinigung Deutschlands auf: ein vereinigtes Deutschland mÃ¼sse in der Nato bleiben. Der franzÃ¶sische PrÃ¤sident Mitterrand tat damals in der Diskussion Ã¼ber eine deutsche Wiedervereinigung nichts anderes. Seine Prinzipien deckten sich mit denen von Bush. Sie unterschieden sich allein in ihrer Anordnung. FÃ¼r Mitterrand war nicht die Nato, sondern die europÃ¤ische Einigung vorrangig. Zwischen dieser und der deutschen sollte es keinen Widerspruch geben. FÃ¼r einen europÃ¤ischen Regierungschef, der  zusammen mit Helmut Kohl  an der Konstruktion eines vereinten Europas arbeitete, war das logisch. Doch: Bush wird seit der Zeitenwende 198990 von den Deutschen gefeiert, ob seines vermeintlich im Herbst 1989 sogleich erfolgten Einsatzes fÃ¼r ihre Wiedervereinigung. Auf Mitterrand hingegen richtet sich seit jener Zeit Kritik. Er hÃ¤tte, so heiÃŸt es, am liebsten die Wiedervereinigung zu verhindern versucht.

I'm wondering what to do with it at the moment, the software was kind of rushed for the event we did so I'm thinking of rewriting most of it from the ground up. Software aside I think the feedback from the students was the most valuable thing.

I'm a bit out of the loop as I haven't worked on my Rift stuff for a few weeks, I'm thinking of doing a series of posts on where to start for people on Macs/on a budget. It depends on what sort experience you have and what you want to achieve. Unity has lots of assets you can borrow to try things out, I did a how to use assets to make a unity game in ten minutes video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kuQYcIYPvQ . Unfortunately Unity is only free for 3 months and then you have to pay (you should get a free 3 month trial with your rift).

If you are a web developer three.js is good because it's free and it uses open standards. If you look for the ""Oculus Bridge"" github and download the zip file there are some three.js examples in there. I guess the draw back are that you need to be able to visualise what your code looks like, which I am not very good at! Also the browser based things can't be as complex as things you can do in Unity that compile natively. 

Torque3D supports the Rift, but it seems to be easier to use on Windows with pre written examples  being windows based. I did a windows screen grab of setting up Torque3D but wasn't sure if it worked on Mac: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgWqsYxZQ6M

The latest version of the Source engine supports Oculus Rift, I haven't tried it but I wonder if you could make a Half Life 2 Mod style thing for the rift.

EDIT: I didn't expect Disqus to auto-embed my videos!  

If you have a Windows partition you can download a Oculus Rift version of the UDK from the Oculus dev site, but last time I checked it was very buggy, 

I think the C   library might be best suited for people making game engines etc as you have to deal with all the little stuff like tracking etc. Also, I expect the sdk to change quite a lot before release, so if C   isn't your thing you might want to let other people worry about that. Still, the C   library is an option on the Mac.

I'm still finding my way around at the moment, it would be really good to hear what other environments people find work well on the Mac. I'm hoping to do some work on three.js this week so I'll keep you updated. Let me know if you find anything interesting out while you are looking at ways to prepare your Mac.

Mac games: I would definitely try out Half Life 2 if you have it (if not Team Fortress is free), Surgeon Simulator is pretty funny too. When I'm showing it to my friends I like Parrot Coaster because they don't have to do anything except sit still. Checking the top ten on http://www.riftenabled.com/ every so often is a good way to see what people are doing, mostly these are Unity based.",1,310,,0,311

I believe it's because the distortion filters for each eye are made using Render Textures, a pro-only feature (feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken anyone).

The NO HMD error usually means that the Oculus isn't connected/properly installed (I get it when trying to run my projects with oculus disconnected). I don't know whether the Unity-Oculus communication is able to be engaged at all on the free version of unity, or whether it should be able to detect and use the oculus for control even if the stereo rendering isn't supported.",1,328,,0,329

Tweets are in many sense similar to the comments you mine so I might have some us full info. Each topic you have doesn't consist of only 5 topics, it's a distribution of all the words used in your data. In other words if some of the 5 word topics don't make sense, try 10, 15 or even 20. I'm not sure how to set that in R, but its possible. As for the shortness of the comments: aggregate the comments into larger documents. There are numerous articles about Mallet's topic modeling algorithm called LDA performing better on larger document sizes. How you aggregate your documents, by user, day or subreddits, is a state of art technique. You have to try. Finally about the number of Tweets: try from 10 to 200. You have to run your data for come different topic numbers and then take a look at the topics and see if they make sense. If many topics seem to be about very different topics, higher the number of topics; if you see your topics correspond more to objects and some themes are grained to a few topics, try increasing your topic number.

Why do people think that Web apps will be made in JavaScript when X3D is not emulated and thus would seem like a faster model? In addition X3D is is a high level API which is easier (?) to use and it's been standardized to work with the web and with multiuser experiences. The fact that it is high level and is based on an engine that is always on means that there is less need to start up an engine each time a new app is ran which would make going from one app space to another a smoother experience. I know that X3D is not good for games but I think most pages will be social spaces rather than games.  And if there needs to be lower level programming wouldn't Native Client be a much better way of enhancing X3D? Its faster and it portability also makes it more likely that competing standards with X3D don't fragment the web.,1,0,,0,346

After going to the PC to deposit it, they accidentally released “ABBBBBBK(” (a.k.a. Abby) the Charmeleon and “JLVWNNOOOO” (a.k.a. Jay Leno) the Rattata. They also put Pidgeot, the highest-level Pokémon on the team, and the Helix Fossil into the PC, although both were later retrieved. Because the source of all this was Eevee, it soon became known as a “false prophet” and servant of the Dome Fossil, an item that was viewed as Satan. A day later, Flareon was released as well.

Firstly, I bump in to your work all over the place. That must be a sign of an open practitioner! Putting your practice online through your blog, youtube etc is partially the reason for that, but to be honest I bump in to it more through the conversations that surround it.

Secondly, I'm much more relaxed about putting up thoughts to share, talk about and think through. I used to be really worried about being made to defend them, but I know that I am just exploring things and thinking as I type and thats ok, I think that's what I took away from your practices. Perhaps from the way you interact with my work? I guess being an open practitioner isn't just about the way you display your own work, but more so how you treat fellow practitioners?

I have a book somewhere on the core principles of education, chapter one is all about fallibilism and allowing critique, which is important I'm sure, but the way we go about critiquing someones work to encourage them rather then hurt them is missing from the book.",1,395,,0,396

If I write ""me"" in Add Nodes, then it returns ""empty"" in Object Type and ""fetched (200)"" in Query Status. 
If I past my user_id in Add Nodes, then it returns ""data"" in Object Type and ""error (404)"" in Query Status. If I click into error (404), it gives me following message:

Games are made for everyone Due to playing Games , the concentration of brain improves .
Games which comes with the label 'Free' are not merely just free , after playing some starting levels , their is a sudden flash appears on screen for 'Buy' or 'Subscribe'
, When the people starts gaming interestingly then this occurs generally . Due to which , mostly disappointed and uninstall it or remove it and try for getting another one which is as similar as earlier . Most of the games on internet first comes freely as a trail version , then after few months full version of the same Game launched , but they have to pay for it  . So this is a strategy of the vendor  or the game developer to earn a big money or to popular the company .",1,0,,0,493

The in-app purchases are for gems, which can be used to accelerate the development of your village or troops.

You can play alone, but the main idea is to join groups of other player (clans), and you can help them out by sending spare troops and communicate with them on your clan-only chat room.

The gameplay revolves around building and upgrading your village, which is periodically attacked by other players outside your clan, and you can attack other players' villages (or computer-controlled goblins) for various tangible (resources) or intangible (progress) rewards.

A central challenge is to redesign your village layout to repel attacks more successfully (you can continually redesign your village by moving parts around).

Although you do not have to buy gems (I have not), players who start player later can find it difficult to catch up with those who started earlier, hence one motivation to buy gems to gain parity. The accumulated village upgrades represent an investment in time and effort, and there will generally always be higher levels to aspire to for the average player, including progression to the higher ""leagues"".

The gameplay is periodically tweaked through updates, which can also add new, higher levels (to aspire to).

I think this about covers the list of natural desires you mention at the end of your article.

Where does a game cross the line between being ""compulsively addictive"" and ""cynically-manipulative cash cow predicated on the exploitation of immature longings for peer acceptance""?

I am not equipped to answer that question. However, I do believe that games like Clash of Clans are clearly better for individuals and society in most respects than gambling games, for example.

Thanks for this, and yes it is one of those first world, 21st century problems. But this audit of our every thought and word can't be dismissed by ironic hashtagging.  Although I do really try to be honest and open, I do have my own internal censorship -- I guess we all should. Sometimes it works better than others. But I am aware of my digital identity, and increasingly how assumptions can be made via a 140 character tweet, and all too quickly someone could read tweet, not the post and make some unfounded assumption on my views. A key part of being an open practitioner (imho) is knowing when to be open. We all share everything, but I hope that when I do it means something - even if it is just to me.

another great post.  Do you follow Catherine Cronin, Bonnie Stewart? They are both doing PhDs just now around online academic identity so are writing (and tweeting) about these very issues. Audrey Waters has also had similar experiences and has written extensively about gamer gate.   As you point out there is a dangerous, double edge sword to the immediacy of twitter and anonymity of twitter.

As you know I 'amplify' a lot using twitter, it is a key part of my academic identity. Fortunately I have only had 2 instances of hate tweets.  I work in a small network, with supportive male and female members.  That said I do probably use a lot of unconscious editing and self censorship because I am a woman. There are some things that I see some of the men in my network tweeting that I would never do, because I know I would get abuse simple because I am a woman.

I think there is a far more fundamental educational issue around democracy and tolerance.  We all have a responsibility to develop those in our selves and with our students, colleagues, family and friends.

I think the gender imbalance in technology and society in generally is getting worse. There are still far too many middle aged, middle class, white men in power. I may have to stop ranting here, but two words sum it up Nigel Farage.

Anyway we need to keep exposing the bigotry, the fear, and keeping communication channels open. If we stop using twitter the bigots and the bullies have won.",1,0,,0,538

* I think its interesting you bring up Nigel Farage, when I was writing about victimisers using Twitter to create fashionable narrative that can be exploited, the 'middle aged, middle class, white men' narrative was also very much on my mind (Farage, Clarkson petition). These narratives are almost always destructive against the target or individuals who speak out. It makes it difficult to add anythine to the conversation. On the anti-feminist theme there is an article on the Guardian describing how  Felicia Day got abuse minutes after she posted about how she found it hard to discuss the topic because she was frightened of getting abuse! The gaming one is touches on this because it is white male dominated and there is very strong reaction if you even approach that issue.

http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/23/felicia-days-public-details-online-gamergate

* I think your sentence this is a very true:

'there is a far more fundamental educational issue around democracy and tolerance. We all have a responsibility to develop those in our selves and with our students, colleagues, family and friends. '

But, I have another worry (that I am having trouble untangling) that touches on Zoe Quinn's interview. After all that harassment she still didn't see the individuals as the problem, she saw that they were being influenced by how organisations interact and treat their end users.  How does Twitter treat its users? What about my institution? By doing x or y with our users data/communication are we justifying individuals doing the same kind of analysis to each other? That analysis is quickly turned into 'fashionable narrative' .

* Your double edged sword comment also rings true. I don't think this is true just for Twitter, but also crowd funding etc.",1,538,,1,539

I have been using your great method for my PhD research for over six months now and it has been very effective and a true lifesaver! Unfortunately, today I have received this message on the Facebook Graph API Explorer website:
 {
  ""error"": {
    ""message"": ""(#10) To use 'Page Public Content Access', your use of this endpoint must be reviewed and approved by Facebook.

    ""fbtrace_id"": ""H2dvYgThVW2""
  }
}

As I am neither a developer nor do I have any programming skills, I would like to ask you for advice on this matter since I have no idea what to do...
Many thanks in advance!
Best wishes,

I have used your method to store comments for my PhD research. Since around two weeks Facebook API Graph Explorer requests a review for this method. 
Do you have any advice what to do about that? 
Cheers, Diem-Tu

Thank you very much for helping us to figure this out. I have learned how to collect data from FB pages. I need to know how to do the same with groups. How can I collect posts and comments from any group? Can you walk me through the process? I would be very grateful. 

One more thing, since FB has changed its privacy policy, I no longer can get the name of the commentator which is a terrible thing for my research. Is there any other way/program/app to overcome this problem? I can not use the API Graph because I don't have the access token of the page since it is not mine. Any clue?

Thank a lot in advance.",1,0,,0,1453
